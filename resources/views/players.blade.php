                                    OnlineSportsTalent is a platform under construction, for the love of sport and dreams of athletes. We're committed to improvement, and you're an integral part of this journey. The more you engage and share your experience on socials, the stronger the platform becomes for everyone. So – share OnlineSportsTalent as much as possible. And the more OnlineSportsTalent will be important for clubs. Sometimes you will experience flaws when we build out the site. Rest sure that we do it on purpose to make the platform better. During our initial phase, our services are absolutely free. However, once we reach a certain threshold, we will establish a fair pricing structure based on the value that OnlineSportsTalent brings to the table. For all 1000 first movers this service is free for 6 months. After this this OnlineSportsTalent might charge $ 5 per month, with ½y subscriptions. And if you get a contract – we charge nothing. This is between you and the club / organization.
